# Layer requirements for AWS Lambda Layer (shared heavy dependencies)
# This file should include only the packages that are large, used by multiple Lambda functions,
# and do not change frequently. This helps keep individual function packages small.

# --- Core Data/DB/Cloud ---
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9         # PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB client (for RDS)
boto3==1.34.82                  # AWS SDK for Python (Lambda, Secrets Manager, S3, etc.)
botocore==1.34.82               # Required by boto3

# --- Data Science / Finance APIs ---
yfinance==0.2.40                # Yahoo Finance API (used for metadata enrichment)
polygon-api-client==1.12.0      # Polygon.io REST API client

# --- HTTP/Networking ---
requests==2.31.0                # Standard HTTP client
curl-cffi==0.6.2                # Used for advanced HTTP requests (impersonation, etc.)

# --- Utilities ---
python-dotenv==1.0.1            # For loading .env files (local testing, not used in Lambda prod)
# (add any other shared, heavy, or C-extension dependencies here)

# --- Notes ---
# - Do NOT include packages only used by a single Lambda function here.
# - Test locally with: pip install -r layer_requirements.txt -t ./layer_test
# - After editing, rebuild the layer with: ./build_layer.sh
